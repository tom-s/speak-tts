Speech synthesis made easy - Browser based text to speech (TTS)
===

## Installation

```bash
npm install speak-tts
```

## Description

Speech synthesis (tts) for the browser. Wrapping the browser Speech Synthesis API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) and providing a similar interface, it improves it by :
- giving a Promise-base API (the init() and speak() methods respectively returns a Promise)
-> init() get resolved once voices are loaded
-> speak() get resolved once the full text has been spoken
- handling the fact that Chrome load voices in an asynchronous manner when others browsers don't
-> onvoiceschanged listener gets triggered in all browsers
- handling some quirks and bugs of IOS/android devices and some chrome/firefox versions 
- splitting sentences into several speeches to make it sound more natural, especially for older versions of Chrome (can be disabled)
- throwing specific exceptions: explicit exceptions will be thrown if you pass parameters with incompatible values to any of the methods

Work in Chrome, opera and Safari. Tested successfully on Ipad and Android.

## Demo

Here is a demo:

## Usage

Import the library :

```javascript
import Speech from 'speak-tts' // es6
// var Speech = require('speak-tts') //if you use es5
```

Check for browser support :

```javascript
const speech = new Speech() // will throw an exception if not browser supported
if(speech.hasBrowserSupport()) { // returns a boolean
	console.log("speech synthesis supported")
}
```

Init the speech component :

```javascript
const speech = new Speech()
speech.init().then((data) => {
	// The "data" object contains the list of available voices and the voice synthesis params
	console.log("Speech is ready, voices are available", data)
}).catch(e => {
	console.error("An error occured while initializing : ", e)
})
```

You can pass the following properties to the init function:
- volume //default 1
- lang // default is determined by your browser if not provided
- voice : the voice to use // default is chosen by your browser if not provided
- rate // default 1
- pitch //  default 1
- splitSentences // default true (or a string with custom sentence-deliminating characters: '.?!' is default)
- listeners // object of listeners to attach to the SpeechSynthesis object

```javascript
// Example with full conf 
Speech.init({
   	'volume': 1,
		'lang': 'en-GB',
		'rate': 1,
		'pitch': 1,
		'voice':'Google UK English Male',
		'splitSentences': true,
		'listeners': {
			'onvoiceschanged': (voices) => {
				console.log("Event voiceschanged", voices)
			}
		}
})
```

Read a text :

```javascript
speech.speak({
	text: 'Hello, how are you today ?',
}).then(() => {
	console.log("Success !")
}).catch(e => {
	console.error("An error occurred :", e)
})
```

You can pass the following properties to the speak function:
- text: text to be spoken
- queue // default true: if set to false, the current speech utterance will be interrupted
- listeners // object of listeners to attach to the SpeechSynthesisUtterance (see list on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesisUtterance)

Read a text (example with all params):

```javascript
speech.speak({
	text: 'Hello, how are you today ?',
	queue: false // current speech will be interrupted,
	listeners: {
		onstart: () => {
			console.log("Start utterance")
		},
		onend: () => {
			console.log("End utterance")
		},
		onresume: () => {
			console.log("Resume utterance")
		},
		onboundary: (event) => {
			console.log(event.name + ' boundary reached after ' + event.elapsedTime + ' milliseconds.')
		}
	}
}).then(() => {
	console.log("Success !")
}).catch(e => {
	console.error("An error occurred :", e)
})
```

Set language (note that the language must be supported by the client browser) :

```javascript
Speech.setLanguage('en-US')
```

Set the voice (note that the voice must be supported by the client browser) :

```javascript
Speech.setVoice('Fiona') // you can pass a SpeechSynthesisVoice as returned by the init() function or just its name
```

Set the rate :

```javascript
Speech.setRate(1) 
```

Set the volume :

```javascript
Speech.setVolume(1) 
```

Set the pitch :

```javascript
Speech.setPitch(1) 
```

Pause talking in progress:

```javascript
Speech.pause()
```

Resume talking in progress:

```javascript
Speech.resume()
```

Cancel talking in progress:

```javascript
Speech.cancel()
```

Get boolean indicating if the utterance queue contains as-yet-unspoken utterances:

```javascript
Speech.pending()
```

Get boolean indicating if talking is paused:

```javascript
Speech.paused()
```

Get boolean indicating if talking is in progress:

```javascript
Speech.speaking()
```
